# crypto_api_pull
Automating Crypto API pull using python 
This repository contains a Python script for automatically pulling data from a cryptocurrency API and saving it to a CSV file. The script uses the requests library to make HTTP requests to the API, and pandas to store the data in a CSV file.

Prerequisites
Before running the script, you need to have Python 3 installed on your machine. You also need to install the following libraries:

requests
pandas
You can install them by running the following command:

Copy code
-- pip install requests pandas


Open the api.ipynb file and replace the placeholder API key with your own API key. You can obtain an API key from the coinmarketcap website.
